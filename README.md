"E.S.G. stands for environmental, social, and governance, and E.S.G. investing is about allocating resources in a way that makes money while also improving the world."

(ESG)-driven portfolios are already a large and growing portion of global assets under management (35 Trillion).  And that’s expected to grow to about one-third of all assets under management by 2025 (Freakonomics). 

Concerns revolve around ongoing challenges regarding the lack of standardization in disclosure standards, the metrics used to measure progress, and the units of measure for specific ESG issues. 

Kelly Shue, Professor of Finance at the Yale School of Management, presents an additional critique of the ESG movement. She classifies firms into two categories: brown firms, which represent the top 20 percent with the highest greenhouse gas emissions per unit of sales, and green firms, which belong to the bottom 20 percent with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions per unit of sales.

## Examples of Brown Frims:

Duke Energy, Southwest Airlines, Tyson Foods, DuPont, FedEx

## Example of Green Firms:

Spotify, Prudential, Goldman Sachs, Allstate, MetLife, American Express. Silicon Valley Bank

She contends we are making two mistakes. The primary E.S.G. strategy is to invest in firms that are already green, and can’t get much greener; E.S.G. money isn’t going to companies that are developing new green technology; it’s going to firms that already don’t pollute much: like banks, insurance companies, software firms, ect. Disinvesting from brown firms, which raises their cost of capital and encourages them to make short-term decisions, which often leads to more pollution rather than less.


"So I think there’s something to your point, which is that if we were to punish brown firms to an extreme extent, make it infinitely expensive for them to raise capital, they’re going to go out of business, and if they go out of business, they can’t pollute. The problem is that brown firms exist in a lot of sectors that are actually crucial to a well-functioning society. So it’s not just coal mining, which we might all think of as evil and could be easily replaced. It also includes agriculture, transportation, building materials, natural-resource extraction. So these are sectors that are quite valuable, and I think it would make more sense to try to make these sectors more green per unit of output rather than to say we can eliminate them entirely"(Kelly Shue) 

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to pull together a (1) NLP Dataset- new sources (2) Pubically aviable data on public companions to evalute "Brown" and "Green" firms.
