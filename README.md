# Decoding Corporate Narratives: A RAG-Based Approach to Navigating 10-K Filings

This project is an attempt to understand the shifting messaging ESG messaging in 10-K filings using a RAG (Retrival Augmented Generation Pipeline). 

## The Landscape

ESG metrics encompass three fundamental pillars: 

1. The "E" dimension evaluates a company's management of natural resources and its environmental impact, encompassing both direct operations and supply chain activities.

2. The "S" aspect pertains to social factors, assessing a company's effectiveness in navigating social trends, labor practices, and political dynamics.

3. The "G" component of ESG focuses on governance factors, examining decision-making processes from governmental policy-making to the allocation of rights and responsibilities within corporations. This includes scrutiny of governance structures involving the board of directors, managers, shareholders, and stakeholders

ESG ratings play a role in guiding trillions of dollars in investments worldwide. For example, the investment strategy of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System Pension Fund is guided by ESG criteria, and they highlight the significance of integrating sustainability factors for long-term investment success.

In recent years, ESG-related shareholder proposals—an official vehicle through which shareholders can interface with the board of directors—have become more prominent.

#### The Challenges 


1. Lack of transparency among the ESG raters on how the scores are assigned.
2. Lack of standards on how a particular concept is measured.
3. Questionable tradeoffs: high scores in one domain may offset very low scores in another area.
4. Absence of an overall score combining performance scores along Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) axes; weights given to the "E," "S," and "G."
5. Lack of acknowledgement of stakeholder expectations.



## The Data

This analysis specifically examines the 966 US equities in which the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund has invested. The $1.4 trillion fund, managed by the Norwegian government, originated from oil and gas resources discovered in the late 1960s on the Norwegian continental shelves. Serving as a strategic financial reserve, the fund holds stakes in about 9,000 companies worldwide, owning approximately 1.4 percent of every listed company globally. 

I have chosen to focus on this subset of publicly traded companies to benchmark US firms against European long-term sustainable investing strategies, specifically examining the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund's voting guidelines. This approach aims to compare the governance and sustainability practices of American corporations with those promoted by one of Europe's most significant investors, known for its adherence to ESG principles.

## The Goal
The goal of this project is to equip large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific data derived from the 10-K disclosure filings of 968 publicly traded firms, as well as the Norwegian Wealth Fund's voting patterns on shareholder proposals. Enabling the LLMs to tailor their outputs, drawing context from authoritative sources concerning environmental, social, and governance (ESG) messaging and Corprate Goverannce. 

## An Overview: 

This project is broken down into a few steps. 

#### 1. Data Collection from Norwegian Sovereing Wealth Fund to get the list of US equities:
   
A link to the API can be found here: [Norges Bank Investment Management API](https://www.nbim.no/en/responsible-investment/voting/our-voting-records/api-access-to-our-voting/) 

The code used to collect data can be found: _Step_1_DataCollection.ipynb_


#### 2. Data Collection from SEC EDGAR System to get Corprate 10-K filings:

Link to sec-api.io : https://sec-api.io/docs/sec-filings-item-extraction-api
 
#### 3. Data preprocessing: Ingesting text into a pdf then turn into dictionary, split into chunks and report on token count. 

Link to open source nlp preprocesser spaCy: https://spacy.io/api/sentencizer

#### 4. Embedding the chunks: use a pretrained model mpnet-base model

# Step 2: Use sec-api.io to pull 10-K by ticker: 

See link: [SEC-API](https://sec-api.io/)

```
!pip install sec-api
```

See query: 

```
import pickle
import re
from tqdm import tqdm

# Assuming `df_documents_info_cleaned` is your DataFrame containing the URLs and metadata
documents_info = []

for index, row in tqdm(df_documents_info_cleaned.iterrows(), total=df_documents_info_cleaned.shape[0], desc="Fetching and Cleaning Documents"):
    # Extract necessary information from the row
    ticker = row['ticker']
    filedAt = row['filedAt']
    sector = row['sector']
    filing_url = row['linkToFilingDetails']
    
    # Fetch the document text for both sections 1 and 1A
    section_1_text = extractorApi.get_section(filing_url, "1", "text")
    section_1A_text = extractorApi.get_section(filing_url, "1A", "text")
    
    # Combine both sections' texts
    combined_text = section_1_text + " " + section_1A_text  # Ensure there's a space between the two sections
    
    # Clean the combined section text
    cleaned_combined_section = re.sub(r"\n|&#[0-9]+;", "", combined_text)
    
    # Append a dictionary for each document containing its metadata and cleaned combined text
    documents_info.append({
        'ticker': ticker,
        'filedAt': filedAt,
        'sector': sector,
        'text': cleaned_combined_section
    })

# Serialize the list of dictionaries to a file using pickle
with open('Cleaned_US_Item1_1A.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(documents_info, f)
```

Convert to Pandas Dataframe: 

```
# Load the serialized data from the pickle file
with open('Cleaned_US_Item1_1A.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    documents_info = pickle.load(f)
```

Example pull for a 10-K document, get section 1A Risks and clean the text)

### For the sake of this example, filter out dataframe and only consider 10-K disclosures for 2023 in the Utility Sector

```
# Load the serialized data from the pickle file
with open('Cleaned_US_Item1_1A.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    documents_info = pickle.load(f)

# Create a DataFrame from the documents_info list
Cleaned_US_Item1_1A = pd.DataFrame(documents_info)

df_2023 = Cleaned_US_Item1_1A[Cleaned_US_Item1_1A['filedAt'].str.startswith('2023')]

unique_utility_df = df_2023[df_2023['sector'] == 'Utilities']

```


### Creating a PDF with Metadata (there way to do this) 
```
def draw_metadata(c, metadata, width, height):
    """Draws metadata at the top of each page."""
    c.setFont("Helvetica", 12)
    c.drawString(72, height - 50, f"Ticker: {metadata['ticker']}, Sector: {metadata['sector']}, Filed At: {metadata['filedAt']}")

def add_text_to_page(c, text, metadata, width, height):
    """Adds text to a page ensuring metadata is drawn first and proper spacing is maintained."""
    draw_metadata(c, metadata, width, height)
    text_object = c.beginText(72, height - 100)  # Adjusted to leave space below the metadata
    text_object.setFont("Helvetica", 10)
    for line in text.split():
        line = preprocess_text(line)  # Preprocess each line if necessary
        if text_object.getX() + c.stringWidth(line) > width - 72:
            text_object.textLine()  # Move to next line if text exceeds the page width
        if text_object.getY() < 100:  # Check if we're near the bottom of the page
            c.drawText(text_object)  # Draw the text collected so far
            c.showPage()  # Start a new page
            draw_metadata(c, metadata, width, height)  # Redraw metadata at top of the new page
            text_object = c.beginText(72, height - 100)
        text_object.textOut(line + " ")  # Add space between words
    c.drawText(text_object)  # Make sure to draw any remaining text
    c.showPage()  # Ensure a new page is started after finishing each company's text

def create_pdf(df, filename):
    """Creates a PDF file with each entry separated onto a new page with metadata at the top."""
    c = canvas.Canvas(filename, pagesize=letter)
    width, height = letter
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        metadata = {'ticker': row['ticker'], 'sector': row['sector'], 'filedAt': row['filedAt']}
        add_text_to_page(c, row['text'], metadata, width, height)
    c.save()
    print(f"PDF saved as {filename}")

create_pdf(df=unique_utility_df, filename='utility.pdf')
