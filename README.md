"E.S.G. stands for environmental, social, and governance, and E.S.G. investing is about allocating resources in a way that makes money while also improving the world."

(ESG)-driven portfolios are already a large and growing portion of global assets under management (35 Trillion).  And that’s expected to grow to about one-third of all assets under management by 2025 (Freakonomics). 

Concerns revolve around ongoing challenges regarding the lack of standardization in disclosure standards, the metrics used to measure progress, and the units of measure for specific ESG issues. 

## Examples of Brown Frims:

Duke Energy, Southwest Airlines, Tyson Foods, DuPont, FedEx

## Example of Green Firms:

Spotify, Prudential, Goldman Sachs, Allstate, MetLife, American Express. Silicon Valley Bank 


## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to evaluate setiment around ESG topics using annual shareholder meeting notes to benchmark progress (2013-2023). 


## Project Road Map

1. Select and label a subsample of "Brown" and  "Green" firms
2. Convert the preprocessed text into features suitable for machine learning e.g. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
3. Choose appropriate NLP model
4. Model Evaluation 

NLP model to (1) classify (Green/Brown) (2) look for evidence that a firm is meeting enviromental commitments.
