"E.S.G. stands for environmental, social, and governance, and E.S.G. investing is about allocating resources in a way that makes money while also improving the world."

(ESG)-driven portfolios are already a large and growing portion of global assets under management (35 Trillion).  And thatâ€™s expected to grow to about one-third of all assets under management by 2025 (freakonomics). 

Concerns revolve around ongoing challenges regarding the lack of standardization in disclosure standards, the metrics used to measure progress, and the units of measure for specific ESG issues. 

Furthermore, Kelly Shue, Professor of Finance at the Yale School of Management, presents an additional critique of the ESG movement. She classifies firms into two categories: brown firms, which represent the top 20 percent with the highest greenhouse gas emissions per unit of sales, and green firms, which belong to the bottom 20 percent with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions per unit of sales.

Rather than merely divesting from so-called brown firms, Shue argues that this approach inadvertently encourages these companies to continue polluting. Instead, she advocates for investors to actively engage with brown firms, working to transform them into greener entities.

Shue contends that while ESG investors may have good intentions, their actions often fail the logic test. She emphasizes the need for investors to foster change within brown firms to make a meaningful impact.
